# File Browser - SaM

This is a simple file browser written in PHP that allows you to navigate through your files and directories, create new folders, upload files, rename files/folders, and delete files/folders. The file browser has a basic user interface that displays the current directory path and a table of files and folders with their types and sizes. You can easily customize the file browser by changing the CSS styling or adding new features to the PHP code.
