# File Browser - SaM

This is a simple file browser written in PHP that allows you to navigate through your files and directories, create new folders, upload files, rename files/folders, and delete files/folders. The file browser has a basic user interface that displays the current directory path and a table of files and folders with their types and sizes. You can easily customize the file browser by changing the CSS styling or adding new features to the PHP code.

## Usage

The file browser displays the current directory path at the top of the page, and a table of files and folders with their types and sizes. You can navigate through your files and directories by clicking on the folder names. To create a new folder, enter a name in the input field and click the "Create" button. To upload a file, click the "Choose File" button and select a file from your computer, then click the "Upload" button. To rename or delete a file/folder, enter the new name (if renaming) or click the "Delete" button (if deleting), and then click the corresponding button.
